See ['use strict'](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode) for an idea of where this is heading.

## Major points

### Strong-typing
TypeScript, Flow, Elm, and others agree that strong-typing provides safety and predictability.

### Immutable data structures
- TypeScript 2.0 has a [readonly modifier](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/typescript/2016/09/22/announcing-typescript-2-0/#the-readonly-modifier)

### Pure functions

### Expressions > statements

### No null or undefined
- TypeScript 2.0 has [non-nullable types](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/typescript/2016/09/22/announcing-typescript-2-0/#non-nullable-types)
