# es-functional-mode-proposal
Proposal to enable opting JS into operating as a functional language

## Background
See ['use strict'](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode) for an idea of where this is heading.

### Helpful plugin to simulate
https://github.com/bodil/eslint-config-cleanjs

## Major points

### Immutable data structures

### Pure functions

### Expressions > statements

### No null or undefined
